# Pong made in Unity
## Quick Launch

- Click on the play button to play the game, or the quit botton to close the game.
- Use the 'w' and 's' keys to move the paddle on the left and the 'i' and 'k' keys to move the paddle on the right.
- After one of the players gets 5 points, the GAME OVER screen will appear and the player can return to the main menu.
